### **Bag of Words (BoW) - Simplified Explanation**  

üìå **What is it?**  
Bag of Words (BoW) is a simple way to represent text as numbers. It converts text into a **vector of word counts**, ignoring grammar and word order but keeping word frequency.  

üìå **How is it computed?**  
1. **Tokenization** ‚Äì Split text into words (tokens).  
2. **Build Vocabulary** ‚Äì List all unique words from all documents.  
3. **Count Word Occurrences** ‚Äì Create a matrix where each row is a document and each column is a word, with values as word counts.

### **Example of Bag of Words Computation**  

#### **Step 1: Sample Text Data**
Let's take three simple sentences:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ "AI is the future."  
2Ô∏è‚É£ "AI will transform the world."  
3Ô∏è‚É£ "The world is changing with AI."  

#### **Step 2: Build Vocabulary**
The unique words in all sentences:  
üëâ **["AI", "is", "the", "future", "will", "transform", "world", "changing", "with"]**  

#### **Step 3: Create Count Matrix**
| Sentence | AI | is | the | future | will | transform | world | changing | with |
|----------|----|----|-----|--------|------|-----------|-------|----------|------|
| "AI is the future." | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| "AI will transform the world." | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| "The world is changing with AI." | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Each row represents a sentence, and each column represents a word with its respective count in that sentence.

### **Python Code Using `CountVectorizer`**
Your code snippet uses `CountVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` to compute BoW:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Example text data
documents = [
    "AI is the future.",
    "AI will transform the world.",
    "The world is changing with AI."
]

# Initialize CountVectorizer
countVector = CountVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the text data
finalCount = countVector.fit_transform(documents)

# Convert to array to see the result
print(finalCount.toarray())

# Print the vocabulary
print(countVector.get_feature_names_out())
```

### **Output:**
```
[[1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1]]
['ai' 'changing' 'future' 'is' 'the' 'transform' 'will' 'with' 'world']
```
Each row in `finalCount.toarray()` represents a sentence, and each column corresponds to a word in the vocabulary.

### **Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **BoW captures word frequency but ignores meaning and word order.**  
‚úÖ **Good for text classification, but weak for semantic understanding.**  
‚úÖ **Can be improved with TF-IDF to give less importance to common words.**
