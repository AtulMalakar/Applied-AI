### **Key Text Preprocessing Concepts for NLP** 🚀  

When dealing with text data in NLP, preprocessing is crucial to clean and standardize input. Let’s break down the most essential techniques with **real-world examples** and **comparisons**.

---

## **1️⃣ Stop Word Removal**  
📌 **What is it?**  
Stop words are common words (e.g., *is, the, a, an, and, but, or*) that don’t carry much meaning. Removing them helps reduce noise and improve computational efficiency.

📌 **Example:**  
📝 **Raw Text:**  
*"The movie was really good, and I enjoyed it a lot."*  
✅ **After Stop Word Removal:**  
*"movie really good, enjoyed lot."*  

📌 **Real-World Use Case:**  
- Used in **search engines (Google, Bing)** to speed up indexing by ignoring frequent words like "the" and "is."  

📌 **Code Example (Using NLTK in Python):**  
```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "The movie was really good, and I enjoyed it a lot."
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

words = word_tokenize(text)
filtered_text = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]

print(filtered_text)  # Output: ['movie', 'really', 'good', ',', 'enjoyed', 'lot', '.']
```

🔹 **Comparison:**  
✅ **Pros:** Speeds up processing, removes noise  
❌ **Cons:** Sometimes removes useful words (e.g., "not" in "not good")  

---

## **2️⃣ Tokenization**  
📌 **What is it?**  
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words (**word tokenization**) or sentences (**sentence tokenization**).  

📌 **Example:**  
📝 **Raw Text:**  
*"Natural Language Processing is amazing!"*  
✅ **Word Tokenization:**  
`["Natural", "Language", "Processing", "is", "amazing", "!"]`  
✅ **Sentence Tokenization:**  
`["Natural Language Processing is amazing!"]`  

📌 **Real-World Use Case:**  
- **Chatbots (Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT)** use tokenization to understand user input.  

📌 **Code Example (Using NLTK):**  
```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing is amazing! AI is changing the world."

print(word_tokenize(text))  # Output: ['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'is', 'amazing', '!', 'AI', 'is', 'changing', 'the', 'world', '.']
print(sent_tokenize(text))  # Output: ['Natural Language Processing is amazing!', 'AI is changing the world.']
```

🔹 **Comparison:**  
✅ **Pros:** Helps in text analysis, easy to implement  
❌ **Cons:** Some languages (e.g., Chinese) require special tokenization  

---

## **3️⃣ Lemmatization**  
📌 **What is it?**  
Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (*lemma*), considering **meaning and context**. It’s more advanced than stemming.  

📌 **Example:**  
📝 **Raw Words:** `"running", "flies", "better"`  
✅ **Lemmatized Words:** `"run", "fly", "good"`  

📌 **Real-World Use Case:**  
- Used in **text summarization** to reduce words without losing meaning.  

📌 **Code Example (Using WordNet Lemmatizer in NLTK):**  
```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
words = ["running", "flies", "better"]
lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos="v") for word in words]

print(lemmas)  # Output: ['run', 'fly', 'better']
```

🔹 **Comparison:**  
✅ **Pros:** More accurate than stemming  
❌ **Cons:** Requires POS tagging for best results  

---

## **4️⃣ Unigrams, Bigrams, and N-grams**  
📌 **What is it?**  
An **n-gram** is a sequence of *n* words appearing together in text.

📌 **Types of N-grams:**  
- **Unigram (n=1):** `"AI"`, `"is"`, `"amazing"`  
- **Bigram (n=2):** `"AI is"`, `"is amazing"`  
- **Trigram (n=3):** `"AI is amazing"`  

📌 **Real-World Use Case:**  
- **Autocomplete & Next-Word Prediction** (Google Search, SwiftKey, Grammarly).  

📌 **Code Example (Using NLTK):**  
```python
from nltk.util import ngrams
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "AI is amazing and changing the world"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

bigrams = list(ngrams(tokens, 2))
trigrams = list(ngrams(tokens, 3))

print(bigrams)  # Output: [('AI', 'is'), ('is', 'amazing'), ('amazing', 'and'), ...]
print(trigrams)  # Output: [('AI', 'is', 'amazing'), ('is', 'amazing', 'and'), ...]
```

🔹 **Comparison:**  
✅ **Pros:** Captures phrase-level meaning (e.g., “New York” vs. “New” + “York”)  
❌ **Cons:** Higher n-grams increase complexity and sparsity

## **Comparison Table**

| Technique        | What it Does | Example Input | Example Output | Pros | Cons |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|------|------|
| **Stop Word Removal** | Removes common words | "The movie was great" | "movie great" | Reduces noise, speeds up NLP | May remove useful words |
| **Tokenization** | Splits text into words/sentences | "AI is amazing!" | ["AI", "is", "amazing", "!"] | Essential for NLP tasks | Needs special handling for some languages |
| **Lemmatization** | Converts words to their base form | "running", "flies" | "run", "fly" | Context-aware, more accurate | Needs POS tagging |
| **Unigrams, Bigrams, N-grams** | Creates word sequences | "AI is great" | Bigrams: [("AI", "is"), ("is", "great")] | Useful for autocomplete, phrase detection | Higher n-grams lead to data sparsity |

Would you like a **hands-on example** of these techniques on a real dataset? 🚀

### **Hands-on Example: NLP Preprocessing on a Real Dataset** 🚀  
Let’s apply **Stop Word Removal, Tokenization, Lemmatization, and N-grams** to a real-world dataset using Python. We’ll use a **movie review dataset** to demonstrate how these techniques work.

---

### **Step 1: Install Required Libraries**
```python
!pip install nltk pandas
```
---

### **Step 2: Load Sample Movie Review Data** 🎬  
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset (Movie reviews)
data = {
    "Review": [
        "The movie was absolutely fantastic! The acting was great.",
        "I didn’t like the movie. The plot was dull and predictable.",
        "What an amazing film! I will definitely watch it again.",
        "The cinematography was beautiful, but the story was boring.",
        "Terrible movie. Waste of time!"
    ]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

### **Step 3: Tokenization and Stop Word Removal**
```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

def preprocess_text(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())  # Convert to lowercase & tokenize
    filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.isalnum() and word not in stop_words]  # Remove stopwords & punctuation
    return filtered_tokens

df["Tokens"] = df["Review"].apply(preprocess_text)
print(df[["Review", "Tokens"]])
```

✅ **Output Example (Tokenized & Stop Words Removed)**  
| Review | Tokens |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| "The movie was absolutely fantastic! The acting was great." | ['movie', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'great'] |
| "I didn’t like the movie. The plot was dull and predictable." | ['like', 'movie', 'plot', 'dull', 'predictable'] |

---

### **Step 4: Lemmatization**
```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

nltk.download('wordnet')

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

def lemmatize_tokens(tokens):
    return [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens]

df["Lemmatized"] = df["Tokens"].apply(lemmatize_tokens)
print(df[["Tokens", "Lemmatized"]])
```

✅ **Output Example (Lemmatized Words)**  
| Tokens | Lemmatized |
|----------------|----------------|
| ['movie', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'great'] | ['movie', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'great'] |
| ['like', 'movie', 'plot', 'dull', 'predictable'] | ['like', 'movie', 'plot', 'dull', 'predictable'] |

🔹 **Here, "movies" → "movie", "acting" → "act" (if POS tagging was used)**  

---

### **Step 5: N-grams (Bigrams & Trigrams)**
```python
from nltk.util import ngrams

def generate_ngrams(tokens, n):
    return list(ngrams(tokens, n))

df["Bigrams"] = df["Lemmatized"].apply(lambda x: generate_ngrams(x, 2))
df["Trigrams"] = df["Lemmatized"].apply(lambda x: generate_ngrams(x, 3))

print(df[["Lemmatized", "Bigrams", "Trigrams"]])
```

✅ **Output Example (Bigrams & Trigrams)**  
| Lemmatized | Bigrams | Trigrams |
|------------|------------------|--------------------|
| ['movie', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'great'] | [('movie', 'absolutely'), ('absolutely', 'fantastic'), ('fantastic', 'acting'), ('acting', 'great')] | [('movie', 'absolutely', 'fantastic'), ('absolutely', 'fantastic', 'acting'), ('fantastic', 'acting', 'great')] |
| ['like', 'movie', 'plot', 'dull', 'predictable'] | [('like', 'movie'), ('movie', 'plot'), ('plot', 'dull'), ('dull', 'predictable')] | [('like', 'movie', 'plot'), ('movie', 'plot', 'dull'), ('plot', 'dull', 'predictable')] |
